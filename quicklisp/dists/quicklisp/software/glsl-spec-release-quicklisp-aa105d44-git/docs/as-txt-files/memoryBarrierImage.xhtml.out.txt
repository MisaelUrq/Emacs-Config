Name

memoryBarrierImage — controls the ordering of operations on image variables
issued by a single shader invocation

Declaration

void memoryBarrierImage( void);

 

Description

memoryBarrierImage waits on the completion of all memory accesses resulting
from the use of image variables and then returns with no other effect. When
this function returns, the results of any modifications to the content of image
variables will be visible to any access to the same buffer from other shader
invocations. In particular, any modifications made in one shader stage are
guaranteed to be visible to accesses performed by shader invocations in
subsequent stages when those invocations were triggered by the execution of the
original shader invocation (e.g., fragment shader invocations for a primitive
resulting from a particular geometry shader invocation).

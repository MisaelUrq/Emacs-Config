genType faceforward( genType N,
                     genType I,
                     genType Nref);

 

genDType faceforward( genDType N,
                      genDType I,
                      genDType Nref);

 

Parameters

N

    Specifies the vector to orient.

I

    Specifies the incident vector.

Nref

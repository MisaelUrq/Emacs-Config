Name

EndPrimitive — complete the current output primitive on the first vertex stream

Declaration

void EndPrimitive(  void);

 

Description

Available only in the Geometry Shader, EndPrimitive completes the current
output primitive on the first (and possibly only) vertex stream and starts a
new one.No vertex is emitted. Calling EndPrimitive is equivalent to calling
EmitStreamVertex with stream set to 0.

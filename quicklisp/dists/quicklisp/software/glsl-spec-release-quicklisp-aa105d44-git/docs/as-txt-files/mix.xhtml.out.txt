Name

mix — linearly interpolate between two values

Declaration

genType mix(  genType x,
              genType y,
              genType a);

 

genType mix(  genType x,
              genType y,
              float a);

 

genDType mix(  genDType x,
               genDType y,
               genDType a);

 

genDType mix(  genDType x,
               genDType y,
               double a);

 

genType mix( genType x,
             genType y,
             genBType a);

 

genDType mix(  genDType x,
               genDType y,
               genBType a);

 

genIType mix(  genIType x,
               genIType y,
               genBType a);

 

genUType mix(  genUType x,
               genUType y,
               genBType a);

 

genBType mix(  genBType x,
               genBType y,
               genBType a);

 

Parameters

x

    Specify the start of the range in which to interpolate.

y

    Specify the end of the range in which to interpolate.

a

    Specify the value to use to interpolate between x and y.

Description

mix performs a linear interpolation between x and y using a to weight between
them. The return value is computed as $x \times (1 - a) + y \times a$.

The variants of mix where a is genBType select which vector each returned
component comes from. For a component of a that is false, the corresponding
component of x is returned. For a component of a that is true, the
corresponding component of y is returned. Components of x and y that are not
selected are allowed to be invalid floating-point values and will have no
effect on the results.

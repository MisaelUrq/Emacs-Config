Name

unpackDouble2x32 — produce two unsigned integers containing the bit encoding of
a double precision floating point value

Declaration

uvec2 unpackDouble2x32( double d);

 

Parameters

d

    Specifies double precision value to break into a pair of unsigned integers.

Description

unpackDouble2x32 returns a two-component unsigned integer vector representation
of d. The bit-level representation of d is preserved. The first component of
the returned vector contains the 32 least significant bits of the double; the
second component consists the 32 most significant bits.

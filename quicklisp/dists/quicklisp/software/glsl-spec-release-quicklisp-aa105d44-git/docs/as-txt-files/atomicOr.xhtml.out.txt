Name

atomicOr — perform an atomic logical OR operation to a variable

Declaration

int atomicOr( inout int mem,
              int data);

 

uint atomicOr( inout uint mem,
               uint data);

 

Parameters

mem

    The variable to use as the target of the operation.

data

    The data to be logically ORed with to mem.

Description

atomicOr performs an atomic logical OR with data to the contents of mem and
returns the original contents of mem from before the logical operation occured.
The contents of the memory being updated by the atomic operation are guaranteed
not to be modified by any other assignment or atomic memory function in any
shader invocation between the time the original value is read and the time the
new value is written.

Atomic memory functions are supported only for a limited set of variables. A
shader will fail to compile if the value passed to the mem argument of an
atomic memory function does not correspond to a buffer or shared variable. It
is acceptable to pass an element of an array or a single component of a vector
to the mem argument of an atomic memory function, as long as the underlying
array or vector is a buffer or shared variable.

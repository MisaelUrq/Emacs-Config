Name

fma — perform a fused multiply-add operation

Declaration

genType fma(  genType a,
              genType b,
              genType c);

 

genDType fma(  genDType a,
               genDType b,
               genDType c);

 

Parameters

a

    Specifies the first multiplicand.

b

    Specifies the second multiplicand.

c

    Specifies the value to be added to the result.

Description

fma performs, where possible, a fused multiply-add operation, returning a * b +
c. In use cases where the return value is eventually consumed by a variable
declared as precise:

  • fma() is considered a single operation, whereas the expression a * b + c
    consumed by a variable declared as precise is considered two operations.

  • The precision of fma() can differ from the precision of the expression a *
    b + c.

  • fma() will be computed with the same precision as any other fma() consumed
    by a precise variable, giving invariant results for the same input values
    of a, b and c.

Otherwise, in the absense of precise consumption, there are no special
constraints on the number of operations or difference in precision between fma
() and the expression a * b + c.

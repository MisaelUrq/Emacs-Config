Name

frexp — split a floating point number

Declaration

genType frexp( genType x,
               out genIType exp);

 

genDType frexp( genDType x,
                out genIType exp);

 

Parameters

x

    Specifies the value from which significand and exponent are to be
    extracted.

out exp

    Specifies the variable into which to place the exponent

Description

frexp extracts x into a floating-point significand in the range [0.5, 1.0) and
in integral exponent of two, such that:

x = significand ⋅ 2 exponent

The significand is returned by the function and the exponent is returned in the
output parameter exp. For a floating-point value of zero, the significand and
exponent are both zero. For a floating-point value that is an infinity or a
floating-point NaN, the results are undefined.

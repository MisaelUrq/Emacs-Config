Name

gl_SamplePosition — contains the location of the current sample within the
current fragment

Declaration

in vec2 gl_SamplePosition ;

Description

gl_SamplePosition is a fragment language input variable that contains the
location within a fragment of the sample currently being processed. The x and y
components of gl_SamplePosition contain the sub-pixel coordinate of the current
sample and will have values in the range 0.0 to 1.0. The sub-pixel coordinates
of the center of the pixel are always (0.5, 0.5). Any static use of
gl_SamplePosition causes the entire fragment shader to be evaluated per-sample
rather than per-fragment. When rendering to a non-multisample buffer, or if
multisample rasterization is disabled, gl_SamplePosition will be (0.5, 0.5).

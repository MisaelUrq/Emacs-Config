Name

gl_FrontFacing — indicates whether a primitive is front or back facing

Declaration

in bool gl_FrontFacing ;

Description

Available only in the fragment language, gl_FrontFacing is an input variable
whose value is true if the fragment belongs to a front-facing primitive and
false otherwise. The determination of whether a triangle primitive is
front-facing is made by examining the sign of the area of the triangle,
including a possible reversal of this sign as controlled by glFrontFace. One
way to compute this area is:

a=12 ∑ j=0 n-1 x w i y w i+1 - x w i+1 y w i

where x w i and y w i are the x and y window coordinates of the ith vertex of
the n-vertex polygon.

The sign of this computation is negated when the value of GL_CLIP_ORIGIN (the
clip volume origin, set with glClipControl) is GL_UPPER_LEFT.

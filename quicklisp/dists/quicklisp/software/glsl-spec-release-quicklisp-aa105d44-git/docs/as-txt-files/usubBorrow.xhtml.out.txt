Name

usubBorrow — subtract unsigned integers and generate borrow

Declaration

genUType usubBorrow( genUType x,
                     genUType y,
                     out genUType borrow);

 

Parameters

x

    Specifies the first vector to be used in the subtraction operation.

y

    Specifies the second vector to be used in the subtraction operation.

borrow

    Specifies the variable to receive the borrow output of the difference.

Description

usubBorrow subtracts two 32-bit unsigned integer variables (scalars or vectors)
and generates a 32-bit unsigned integer result, along with a borrow output. The
result is the difference of x and y if non-negative, or 232 plus that
difference otherwise. The value borrow is set to 0 if x ≥ y and to 1 otherwise.

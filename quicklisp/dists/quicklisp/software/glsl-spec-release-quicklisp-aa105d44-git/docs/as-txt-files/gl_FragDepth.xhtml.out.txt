Name

gl_FragDepth — establishes a depth value for the current fragment

Declaration

out float gl_FragDepth ;

Description

Available only in the fragment language, gl_FragDepth is an output variable
that is used to establish the depth value for the current fragment. If depth
buffering is enabled and no shader writes to gl_FragDepth, then the fixed
function value for depth will be used (this value is contained in the z
component of gl_FragCoord) otherwise, the value written to gl_FragDepth is
used. If a shader statically assigns to gl_FragDepth, then the value of the
fragment's depth may be undefined for executions of the shader that don't take
that path. That is, if the set of linked fragment shaders statically contain a
write to gl_FragDepth, then it is responsible for always writing it.

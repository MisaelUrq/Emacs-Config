Name

gl_WorkGroupSize — contains the size of the workgroup operated on by a compute
shader

Declaration

const uvec3 gl_WorkGroupSize ;

Description

In the compute language, gl_WorkGroupSize contains the size of a workgroup
declared by a compute shader. The size of the work group in the X, Y, and Z
dimensions is stored in the x, y, and z components of gl_WorkGroupSize. The
values stored in gl_WorkGroupSize match those specified in the required
local_size_x, local_size_y, and local_size_z layout qualifiers for the current
shader. This value is constant so that it can be used to size arrays of memory
that can be shared within the local work group.

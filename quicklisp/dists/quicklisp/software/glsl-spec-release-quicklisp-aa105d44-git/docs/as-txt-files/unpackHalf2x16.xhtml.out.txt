Name

unpackHalf2x16 — convert two 16-bit floating-point values packed into a single
32-bit integer into a vector of two 32-bit floating-point quantities

Declaration

vec2 unpackHalf2x16(  uint v);

 

Parameters

v

    Specify a single 32-bit unsigned integer values that contains two 16-bit
    floating point values to be unpacked.

Description

unpackHalf2x16 returns a two-component floating-point vector with components
obtained by unpacking a 32-bit unsigned integer into a pair of 16-bit values,
interpreting those values as 16-bit floating-point numbers according to the
OpenGL Specification, and converting them to 32-bit floating-point values. The
first component of the vector is obtained from the 16 least-significant bits of
v; the second component is obtained from the 16 most-significant bits of v.

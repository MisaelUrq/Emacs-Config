Name

noise — generate values with a pseudo-random noise function

Declaration

float noise1(  genType x);

 

vec2 noise2(  genType x);

 

vec3 noise3(  genType x);

 

vec4 noise4(  genType x);

 

Parameters

x

    Specifies the value to be used to seed the noise function.

Description

noise1, noise2, noise3 and noise4 return noise values (vector or scalar) based
on the input value x. The noise function is a stochastic function that can be
used to increase visual complexity. Values returned by the noise functions give
the appearance of randomness, but are not truly random. They are defined to
have the following characteristics:

  • The return value(s) are always in the range [-1.0,1.0], and cover at least
    the range [-0.6, 0.6], with a Gaussian-like distribution.

  • The return value(s) have an overall average of 0.0.

  • They are repeatable, in that a particular input value will always produce
    the same return value.

  • They are statistically invariant under rotation (i.e., no matter how the
    domain is rotated, it has the same statistical character).

  • They have a statistical invariance under translation (i.e., no matter how
    the domain is translated, it has the same statistical character).

  • They typically give different results under translation.

  • The spatial frequency is narrowly concentrated, centered somewhere between
    0.5 to 1.0.

  • They are C1 continuous everywhere (i.e., the first derivative is
    continuous).

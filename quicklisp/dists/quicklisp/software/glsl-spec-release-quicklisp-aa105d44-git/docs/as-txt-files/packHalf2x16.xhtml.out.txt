Name

packHalf2x16 — convert two 32-bit floating-point quantities to 16-bit
quantities and pack them into a single 32-bit integer

Declaration

uint packHalf2x16(  vec2 v);

 

Parameters

v

    Specify a vector of two 32-bit floating point values that are to be
    converted to 16-bit representation and packed into the result.

Description

packHalf2x16 returns an unsigned integer obtained by converting the components
of a two-component floating-point vector to the 16-bit floating-point
representation found in the OpenGL Specification, and then packing these two
16-bit integers into a 32-bit unsigned integer. The first vector component
specifies the 16 least-significant bits of the result; the second component
specifies the 16 most-significant bits.

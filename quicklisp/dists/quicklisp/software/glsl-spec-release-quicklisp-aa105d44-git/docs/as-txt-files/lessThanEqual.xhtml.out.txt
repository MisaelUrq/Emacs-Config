vectors

Declaration

bvec lessThanEqual(  vec x,
                     vec y);

 

bvec lessThanEqual(  ivec x,
                     ivec y);

 

bvec lessThanEqual(  uvec x,
                     uvec y);

 

Parameters

x

    Specifies the first vector to be used in the comparison operation.

y

    Specifies the second vector to be used in the comparison operation.

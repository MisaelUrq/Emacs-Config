Declaration

genIType findMSB( genIType value);

 

genIType findMSB( genUType value);

 

Parameters

value

    Specifies the value whose bits to scan.

Description

findMSB returns the bit number of the most significant bit that is set to 1 in
the binary representation of value. For positive integers, the result will be
the bit number of the most significant bit that is set to 1. For negative
integers, the result will be the bit number of the most significant bit set to
0. For a value of zero or negative 1, -1 will be returned.

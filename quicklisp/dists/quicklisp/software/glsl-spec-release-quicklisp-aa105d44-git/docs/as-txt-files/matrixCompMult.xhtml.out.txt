Name

matrixCompMult — perform a component-wise multiplication of two matrices

Declaration

mat matrixCompMult(  mat x,
                     mat y);

 

dmat matrixCompMult(  dmat x,
                      dmat y);

 

Parameters

x

    Specifies the first matrix multiplicand.

y

    Specifies the second matrix multiplicand.

Description

matrixCompMult performs a component-wise multiplication of two matrices,
yielding a result matrix where each component, result[i][j] is computed as the
scalar product of x[i][j] and y[i][j].

Name

packDouble2x32 — create a double-precision value from a pair of unsigned
integers

Declaration

double packDouble2x32( uvec2 v);

 

Parameters

v

    Specifies a vector of two unsigned integers to be packed into a single
    double-precision result.

Description

packDouble2x32 packs the component of parameter v into a 64-bit value. If an
IEEE-754 infinity or NaN is created, it will not signal and the resulting
floating-point value is undefined. Otherwise, the bit-level representation of v
is preserved. The first vector component (v[0]) specifies the 32 least
significant bits of the result; the second component (v[1]) specifies the 32
most significant bits.

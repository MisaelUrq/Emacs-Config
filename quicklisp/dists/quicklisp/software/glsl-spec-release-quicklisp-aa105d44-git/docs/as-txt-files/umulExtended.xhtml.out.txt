Name

umulExtended — perform a 32- by 32-bit multiply to produce a 64-bit result

Declaration

void umulExtended( genUType x,
                   genUType y,
                   out genUType msb,
                   out genUType lsb);

 

void imulExtended( genIType x,
                   genIType y,
                   out genIType msb,
                   out genIType lsb);

 

Parameters

x

    Specifies the first multiplicand.

y

    Specifies the second multiplicand..

msb

    Specifies the variable to receive the most significant word of the product.

lsb

    Specifies the variable to receive the least significant word of the
    product.

Description

umulExtended and imulExtended perform multiplication of the two 32-bit integer
quantities x and y, producing a 64-bit integer result. The 32 least significant
bits of this product are returned in lsb and the 32 most significant bits are
returned in msb. umulExtended and imulExtended perform unsigned and signed
multiplication, respectively.

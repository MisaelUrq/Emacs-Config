Name

gl_SampleID — contains the index of the sample currently being processed

Declaration

in int gl_SampleID ;

Description

gl_SampleID is a fragment language input variable that contains the index of
the sample currently being processed. This variable is in the range 0 to
gl_NumSamples - 1, where gl_NumSamples is the total number of samples in each
fragment for the current framebuffer (and thus 1 if rendering to a
non-multisample buffer). Any static use of this variable in a fragment shader
causes the entire shader to be evaluated per-sample rather than per-fragment.

When rendering to a non-multisample buffer, or if multisample rasterization is
disabled, gl_SampleID will always be zero. gl_NumSamples is the sample count of
the framebuffer regardless of whether multisample rasterization is enabled or
not.

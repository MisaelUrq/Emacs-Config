Name

gl_PrimitiveIDIn — contains the index of the current primitive

Declaration

in int gl_PrimitiveIDIn ;

Description

gl_PrimitiveIDIn is a geometry language input variable that holds the number of
primitives processed by the shader since the current set of rendering
primitives was started. The first primitive processed by the drawing command is
numbered zero and the primitive ID counter is incremented after every
individual point, line or triangle primitive is processed. For triangles drawn
in point or line mode, the primitive ID counter is incremented only once, even
through multiple points or lines may actually be drawn. Restarting a primitive
topology using the primitive restart index has no effect on the primitive ID
counter.

Name

unpackUnorm2x16, unpackUnorm4x8, unpackSnorm4x8 — unpack floating-point values
from an unsigned integer

Declaration

vec2 unpackUnorm2x16(  uint p);

 

vec2 unpackSnorm2x16(  uint p);

 

vec4 unpackUnorm4x8(  uint p);

 

vec4 unpackSnorm4x8(  uint p);

 

Parameters

p

    Specifies an unsigned integer containing packed floating-point values.

Description

unpackUnorm2x16, unpackSnorm2x16, unpackUnorm4x8 and unpackSnorm4x8 unpack
single 32-bit unsigned integers, specified in the parameter p into a pair of
16-bit unsigned integers, four 8-bit unsigned integers or four 8-bit signed
integers. Then, each component is converted to a normalized floating-point
value to generate the returned two- or four-component vector.

The conversion for unpacked fixed point value f to floating-point is performed
as follows:

  • packUnorm2x16: f / 65535.0

  • packSnorm2x16: clamp(f / 32727.0, -1.0, 1.0)

  • packUnorm4x8: f / 255.0

  • packSnorm4x8: clamp(f / 127.0, -1.0, 1.0)

The first component of the returned vector will be extracted from the least
significant bits of the input; the last component will be extracted from the
most significant bits.

Name

memoryBarrierAtomicCounter — controls the ordering of operations on atomic
counters issued by a single shader invocation

Declaration

void memoryBarrierAtomicCounter( void);

 

Description

memoryBarrierAtomicCounter waits on the completion of all accesses resulting
from the use of atomic counters and then returns with no other effect. When
this function returns, the results of any modifications to the value of atomic
counters will be visible to any access to the same counter from other shader
invocations. In particular, any modifications made in one shader stage are
guaranteed to be visible to accesses performed by shader invocations in
subsequent stages when those invocations were triggered by the execution of the
original shader invocation (e.g., fragment shader invocations for a primitive
resulting from a particular geometry shader invocation).

Name

gl_PointCoord — contains the coordinate of a fragment within a point

Declaration

in vec2 gl_PointCoord ;

Description

gl_PointCoord is a fragment language input variable that contains the
two-dimensional coordinates indicating where within a point primitive the
current fragment is located. If the current primitive is not a point, then
values read from gl_PointCoord are undefined.

gl_PointCoord.s ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 across the point horizontally from left
to right. If GL_POINT_SPRITE_COORD_ORIGIN is GL_LOWER_LEFT, gl_PointCoord.t
varies from 0.0 to 1.0 vertically from bottom to top. Otherwise, if
GL_POINT_SPRITE_COORD_ORIGIN is GL_UPPER_LEFT then gl_PointCoord.t varies from
0.0 to 1.0 vertically from top to bottom. The default value of
GL_POINT_SPRITE_COORD_ORIGIN is GL_UPPER_LEFT.

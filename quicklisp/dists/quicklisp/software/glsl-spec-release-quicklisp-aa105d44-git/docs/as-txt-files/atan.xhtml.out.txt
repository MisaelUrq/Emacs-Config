Name

atan — return the arc-tangent of the parameters

Declaration

genType atan(  genType y,
               genType x);

 

genType atan( genType y_over_x);

 

Parameters

y

    Specify the numerator of the fraction whose arctangent to return.

x

    Specify the denominator of the fraction whose arctangent to return.

y_over_x

    Specify the fraction whose arctangent to return.

Description

atan returns the angle whose trigonometric arctangent is y x or y_over_x,
depending on which overload is invoked. In the first overload, the signs of y
and x are used to determine the quadrant that the angle lies in. The values
returned by atan in this case are in the range − π π . Results are undefined if
x is zero.

For the second overload, atan returns the angle whose tangent is y_over_x.
Values returned in this case are in the range − π 2 π 2 .

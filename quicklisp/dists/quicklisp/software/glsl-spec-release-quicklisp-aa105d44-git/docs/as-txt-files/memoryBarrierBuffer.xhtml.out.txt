Name

memoryBarrierBuffer — controls the ordering of operations on buffer variables
issued by a single shader invocation

Declaration

void memoryBarrierBuffer( void);

 

Description

memoryBarrierBuffer waits on the completion of all memory accesses resulting
from the use of buffer variables and then returns with no other effect. When
this function returns, the results of any modifications to the content of
buffer variables will be visible to any access to the same buffer from other
shader invocations. In particular, any modifications made in one shader stage
are guaranteed to be visible to accesses performed by shader invocations in
subsequent stages when those invocations were triggered by the execution of the
original shader invocation (e.g., fragment shader invocations for a primitive
resulting from a particular geometry shader invocation).

Name

gl_SampleMaskIn — contains the computed sample coverage mask for the current
fragment

Declaration

in int gl_SampleMaskIn[] ;

Description

gl_SampleMaskIn is a fragment language that indicates the set of samples
covered by the primitive generating the fragment during multisample
rasterization. It has a sample bit set if and only if the sample is considered
covered for this fragment shader invocation. Bit B of mask gl_SampleMask[M]
corresponds to sample 32 * M + B. The array has ceil(s / 32) elements where s
is the maximum number of color samples supported by the implementation.

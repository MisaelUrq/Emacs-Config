Name

packUnorm — pack floating-point values into an unsigned integer

Declaration

uint packUnorm2x16(  vec2 v);

 

uint packSnorm2x16(  vec2 v);

 

uint packUnorm4x8(  vec4 v);

 

uint packSnorm4x8(  vec4 v);

 

Parameters

v

    Specifies a vector of values to be packed into an unsigned integer.

Description

packUnorm2x16, packSnorm2x16, packUnorm4x8 and packSnorm4x8 convert each
component of the normalized floating-ponit value v into 8- or 16-bit integer
values and then packs the results into a 32-bit unsigned intgeter.

The conversion for component c of v to fixed-point is performed as follows:

  • packUnorm2x16: round(clamp(c, 0.0, 1.0) * 65535.0)

  • packSnorm2x16: round(clamp(c, -1.0, 1.0) * 32767.0)

  • packUnorm4x8: round(clamp(c, 0.0, 1.0) * 255.0)

  • packSnorm4x8: round(clamp(c, -1.0, 1.0) * 127.0)

The first component of the vector will be written to the least significant bits
of the output; the last component will be written to the most significant bits.

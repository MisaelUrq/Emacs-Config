Name

round — find the nearest integer less than or equal to the parameter

Declaration

genType round(  genType x);

 

genDType round(  genDType x);

 

Parameters

x

    Specify the value to evaluate.

Description

round returns a value equal to the nearest integer to x. The fraction 0.5 will
round in a direction chosen by the implementation, presumably the direction
that is fastest. This includes the possibility that round(x) returns the same
value as roundEven(x) for all values of x.

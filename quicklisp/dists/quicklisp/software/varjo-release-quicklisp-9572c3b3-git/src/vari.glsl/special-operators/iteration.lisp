;; Flow-ID resolution
;;
;; - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
;;
;; Purpose of code
;;
;; Ok so iirc the goal of this step is to calculate the flow ids for variables
;; being mutated from within a loop.
;;
;; The base example is below
;;
;;     (let ((a foo)
;;           (b bar))
;;       (for (i 0) (< i 10) (++ i)
;;         (setf a b)))
;;
;; if `a` starts with flow-id 1 and `b` starts with flow-id 2 then after the
;; first iteration `a`'s flow id is 2. Any number of additional loops wont
;; change that.
;;
;; So for the above code the flow is:
;;
;;  | a b
;; =|====
;; 0| 1 2
;; 1| 2 2
;; .| . .
;; n| 2 2
;;
;; and we can say that after the first iteration a fixpoint has been reached.
;;
;; - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
;;
;; Hey future baggers, it's past baggers. I see you've come back to revisit
;; this again, no doubt we've left it just long enough to forget how this
;; works.. thats fair, it's a monstrosity (have we started writing a sane
;; compiler yet?) ANYHOO you are looking for an 'in' to get started with this
;; code. Here is your path:
;;
;; - read #'get-changed-var/flow-id-pairs. it's the first call of note in
;;   #'search-for-flow-id-fixpoint and is fairly easy to follow.
;;
;; - next it's good to know that #'accumulate-flow-ids-into-maps does two
;;   jobs. The first is is to combine the flow-ids, but it also calls
;;   ensure-starting-flow-ids-for-var, so we have a record of the starting
;;   flow-ids these are used by #'fixpoint-reached
;;
;; - search-for-flow-id-fixpoint is best read by looking through the loop,
;;   it's pretty much pseudocode at this point.
;;
;;  - the flow-id-map var is a map of var-name to flow-id
